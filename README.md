Bank loan Case study
Used Technical skills – Advanced excel and Statistics
This case study aims to give the idea of applying EDA in a real business scenario. In this case study, apart from applying the techniques I learned in the EDA module, I also developed a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and how data is used to minimize the risk of losing money while lending to customers. Use the skills of google analytics or excel to find the variables that play a role in identifying a loan defaulter. The following questions were answered:
•	To remove missing and blank data, and to clean the data before analysis, various processes were used, like  Z – Score and conditional formatting, to remove the outliers from the dataset, affecting the analysis's efficiency.
•	To explain the results of univariate, segmented univariate, and bivariate analysis
•	To find the correlation of the variables that played a role in making a candidate – Loan defaulter.
